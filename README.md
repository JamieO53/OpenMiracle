# OpenMiracle
**Clone of the OpenMiracle project on SourceForge for [blog](https://jamieo53.github.io/DevBlog/) examples**

The purpose of this project is to illustrate the use of the [nuget-for-sql-projects](https://github.com/JamieO53/nuget-for-sql-projects) to package SQL Server projects into NuGet packages.

I have chosen this project to illustrate how to migrate a legacy database to a Visual Studio SQL Server project, and to factor out subsystems into referenced database projects.

There is no intention at present to contribute to the original project.
